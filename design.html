                                  <p>To start with typography, I looked at a bunch of idiosyncratic fonts and found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zilla+Slab" class="emphasis">Zilla Slab</a>. To be honest, it looks similar to the book cover and I think it fits the mood perfectly. I know slab fonts look more industrial and, by that logic, don't always work with nature texts but in this case I think it's a good fit and it contrasts the paragraphs nicely.</p>
                                  <p>I went for plenty of negative space to give a real book feel and also to create the tension/suspense that the writing evokes to me. I struck upon <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond" class="emphasis">Eb Garamond</a> which is an elegant humanist serif with a slight grotesque tendency which seemed to work very well for body text. After all the book is written in the 1960s and not centuries ago. I felt like it would be a good idea to have a simple, uncomplicated design as a stage for this extraordinary writing. The emotional qualities that I have recognized within the text are bitter, visceral, poignant. It displays nature in a way that is both ruthless and majestic. I did not want to weaken or diminish this intensity, so I opted for a sharp, clean and serious design.</p> 
                                  <p>I also created a <a href="https://whimsical.com/typesetting-literature-FYxFnRUfsQUF85MUGyPBhU">moodboard</a> to use when choosing the colours. I quite like the end result of black, green and brown. I think it's very similar to the colors of the bird, and it feels classic, rustic and earthy. </p>
